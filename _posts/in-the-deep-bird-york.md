Bem, um bocadinho de musica deprimente… É a musica do filme <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/" target="_blank">crash</a>.

&nbsp;

Thought you had  
all the answers  
to rest your heart upon.  
But something happens,  
don’t see it coming, now  
you can’t stop yourself.  
Now you’re out there swimming…  
In the deep.  
In the deep.

Life keeps tumbling your heart in circles  
till you… Let go.  
Till you shed your pride, and you climb to heaven,  
and you throw yourself off.  
Now you’re out there spinning…  
In the deep.  
In the deep.  
In the deep.  
In the deep.

And now you’re out there spinning…  
And now you’re out there spinning…  
In the deep.  
In the deep.  
In the deep.

In the silence,  
all your secrets, will  
raise their worried heads.  
Well, you can pin yourself back together,  
to who you thought you were.  
Now you’re out there livin’…  
In the deep.  
In the deep.  
In the deep.

In the deep…

Now you’re out there spinning…  
Now you’re out there swimming…  
Now you’re out there spinning…  
In the deep.  
In the deep.  
In the deep.  
In the deep…
